		 In java, type casting is classified into two types,
		
		1. Implicit Casting(Widening)Or Automatic type conversion
		
				byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double 
				
		 		byte = 8-bit
		 		short = 16-bit
		 		int = 32-bit
		 		long = 64-bit
		 		
		 		float = 32-bit
		 		double = 64-bit

                
       2. Explicitly Casting (Narrowing)
       
               double -> float -> long -> int -> short -> byte
